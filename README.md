## Instructions

The computer will mix up the cards for you: there are more than 500 possible
pairs, but you will only play 8! The cards will be laid in rows, face down.
You turn over any two cards: if they match, good for you! If they do not,
fire up those neurons 'cause you'll need them! You will have 45 seconds to
find all the matching pairs. There are also star points, and you'll never
get the maximum three - at least I never did. If you do, send me a
screenshot!

Good luck!

The game is over when all the cards have been matched.the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
