## Instructions

The computer will mix up the cards for you: there are more than 500 possible
pairs, but you will only play 8! The cards will be laid in rows, face down.
You turn over any two cards: if they match, good for you! If they do not,
fire up those neurons 'cause you'll need them! You will have 45 seconds to
find all the matching pairs. There are also star points, and you'll never
get the maximum three - at least I never did. If you do, send me a
screenshot!

Good luck!

The game is over when all the cards have been matched.the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

#Game Behavior


Congratulations Popup

When a user wins the game, a modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again. It should also tell the user how much time it took to win the game, and what the star rating was.

Star Rating

The game displays a star rating (from 1 to at least 3) that reflects the player's performance. At the beginning of a game, it should display at least 3 stars. After some number of moves, it should change to a lower star rating. After a few more moves, it should change to a even lower star rating (down to 1). The number of moves needed to change the rating is up to you, but it should happen at some point.


Move Counter

Game displays the current number of moves a user has made.

Code Quality

Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting as described in the Udacity JavaScript Style Guide.
